My first blog was on blogspot. I didn't even make it myself, it was started for me. The theme was "cows".  Maybe because I reminded her of a cow.

Thanks, Joanna.

I posted for 4 friends listed in the blogroll sidebar, the loyal readers. Cobbling together inside jokes, obscure media references and pop punk song lyrics, hoping it resembled a personality.

Fast forward 20 years, I'm a web developer.

No, really &mdash; thanks, Joanna.
